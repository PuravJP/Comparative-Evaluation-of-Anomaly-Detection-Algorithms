For Synthetic Data
  
  Proximity Based: 
    LOF
      First data generated consisted of equal amounts of global and local anomalies.
      Second data generated consisted only of local anomalies.
      Performance of the lof on the second data was better that the first one.
      The algorithm was tested on default parameters, except "contamination".
      High amounts of anomalies leads to a poorer performance by the LOF.

    CBLOF
      Similar generation of datasets as LOF.
      Performance of the first dataset was better than that of LOF.
      Performance of the second dataset was a decent improvement over the first.

    COF 
      Performance for the first dataset was a little better than the second dataset.
      Improvement in accuracy compared to LOF.
      Slightly decreased ROC AUC than LOF.

    KNN
      Best performance for the global anomalies.
      Second best accuracy for local anomalies.

    ALOI dataset
      Original number of features: 26.
      Features after decomposition: 8 (95% of variance).
      Over 10 to 50 neighbours and clusters(CBLOF) were tested.
      LOF performs the best and stays consisent from 10th to the 50th neighbours.
      KNN performance degrades with increasing neighbours.
      CBLOF performance increases very slightly over the 40 clusters.
