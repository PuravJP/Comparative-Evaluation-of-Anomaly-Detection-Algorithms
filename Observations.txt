For Synthetic Data
  LOF
    First data generated consisted of equal amounts of global and local anomalies.
    Second data generated consisted only of local anomalies.
    Performance of the lof on the second data was significantly better that the first one.
    The algorithm was tested on default parameters, except "contamination".
    High amounts of anomalies leads to a poorer performance by the LOF.
