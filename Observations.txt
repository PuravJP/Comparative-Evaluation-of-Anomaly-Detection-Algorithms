For Synthetic Data
  LOF
    First data generated consisted of equal amounts of global and local anomalies.
    Second data generated consisted only of local anomalies.
    Performance of the lof on the second data was better that the first one.
    The algorithm was tested on default parameters, except "contamination".
    High amounts of anomalies leads to a poorer performance by the LOF.

  CBLOF
    Similar generation of datasets as LOF.
    Performance of the first dataset was better than that of LOF.
    Performance of the second dataset was a decent improvement over the first.

  COF 
    Performance for the first dataset was a little better than the second dataset.
    Improvement in accuracy compared to LOF.
    Slightly decreased ROC AUC than LOF.

  KNN
    Best performance for the global anomalies
    Second best accuracy for local anomalies
