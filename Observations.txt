For Synthetic Data
  
  Proximity Based: 
    LOF
      First data generated consisted of equal amounts of global and local anomalies.
      Second data generated consisted only of local anomalies.
      Performance of the lof on the second data was better that the first one.
      The algorithm was tested on default parameters, except "contamination".
      High amounts of anomalies leads to a poorer performance by the LOF.

    CBLOF
      Similar generation of datasets as LOF.
      Performance of the first dataset was better than that of LOF.
      Performance of the second dataset was a decent improvement over the first.

    COF 
      Performance for the first dataset was a little better than the second dataset.
      Improvement in accuracy compared to LOF.
      Slightly decreased ROC AUC than LOF.

    KNN
      Best performance for the global anomalies.
      Second best accuracy for local anomalies.

    ALOI dataset
      Original number of features: 26.
      Features after decomposition: 8 (95% of variance).
      Over 10 to 50 neighbours and clusters(CBLOF) were tested.
      LOF performs the best and stays consisent from 10th to the 50th neighbours.
      KNN performance degrades with increasing neighbours.
      CBLOF performance increases very slightly over the 40 clusters.

    Thyroid dataset
      Original number of features: 21
      Features after standardization and decomposition: 19
      LOF and COF have the best auc Score
      COF's AUC increases over the neighbours
      LOF's AUC decreases(slightly) with the increase in neighbours
      The average for both of them is almost same
      CBLOF's performance increases with increase in neighbours but is worse compared to all the other algorithms
      KNN's AUC on the other hand is in the middle of the pack and decreases(moderately) with increase in neighbours
